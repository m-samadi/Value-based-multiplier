# Value-based multiplier
This program is the simulation process of the value-based multiplier presented in the paper entitled "A novel value-based multiplier architecture to multiply BCD numbers by powers of 10" published by Inderscience Publishers on 30 March 2022.
<br/>
<br/>
The repository includes the VHDL codes of the multiplier, the components with VHDL entities, and the output of the simulation. The simulation can be started by executing the BCD_PT.vhd file.
<br/>
<br/>
## Programming language and IDE
The program is written in VHDL language. It is compiled and synthesized with Active-HDL v8.3 SP1.
